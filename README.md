 How to build your own low-cost multipurpose demographics atlas
 
 # Intro
 Nowadays, many business activities are based on geodemography data. You can get to know the term from this article [10 reasons to use geodemography](https://environicsanalytics.com/resources/blogs/ea-blog/2011/05/03/10-reasons-to-use-geodemography). Basically you want to know:

1. Location: geocoordinates, size, topographies, infrastructure (rural, urban), building counts, surrounding traits...etc.

2. People in that location (demographics): how many are living in the area, where exactly their houses are, ages, sex, income, insurance types, education level, political belief...etc.

With those insights, companies can understand their customers better through advance segmentation methods or more precise customer behavior simulations. Hence, supply chains can be better positioned and marketing campaigns can be designed to reduce costs and increase revenues. Many market research companies provide you the services either through one-time-sale or subscription; and usually, they neither reveal how the data is collected, refreshed nor analyzed.
